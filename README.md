        If you can find that last key on the website, then surely you can get into the class and become a world master of the aquatic art. What are you waiting for? "GO GET THAT KEY".</td>

    <td>The other night we caught two individuals who we believe to be spies on our CCTV cameras. During their interaction, one of the spies was writing what is suspected to be the password to their organization's secure communications line.
        When they realized our camera was there, they attempted to destroy it. They succeeded. However, we were able to recover some of the footage of the entire incident, along with a few frames of when they were getting away. 
        We know they dropped the code somewhere and we've narrowed our search of the key to one frame, but we can't seem to find it. Do you think you can "assist us"?</td>

        Moss: There’s an iPhone, Jen! An actual iPhone! 
        Jen: I need your password. I need the password for the translation program. 
        Moss: Help me get the iPhone first. I can’t move my arms. 
        Jen: No. 
        Moss: I need to get it through the shoot. Someone else will take it if you don’t. 
        Jen: I’m sure they’re not giving it away. An engineer must have dropped it. 
        Moss: No. No. No, it’s a prize! It’s a prize! You’ve gotta help! 
        Jen: I don’t have time. 
        Moss: But it’s an iPhone, Jen. I may be able to get an iPhone without giving any money to Apple! I’ll be living the dream!

        Jen: Where is it? 
        Moss: I must be blocking it. I’ll try and move to clear the passage. 
        [Moss tries to move with no luck] 
        Jen: Come on, Moss. 
        [Moss keeps trying, sweat accumulating on his face] 
        Jen: Come on, Moss. You can do it. Push! Come on, Moss. Keep breathing. PUSH! 
        Moss: Shut up! 
        [Moss keeps trying]

        However, during the initial development, the \"brilliant\" developers seemed to have misplaced the key that gives exclusive access to people who will pay big bucks to get even better odds of getting their ideal companion cube.
        Can you dig through this and find that key? Perhaps management will give you your very own companion cube and not some raw sewage container that you will rub your face on.</td>

        From what we understand, this hardware is cheap and rather small. We tried to get the specs from our current time machine, but the damage caused by getting Archimedes here has caused it to spit out everything in a "strange encryption scheme".
        We have been at this for hours...do you think you can try to solve it?</td>

    <td>After a long, relaxing excursion to the town of Pripyat and the areas surrounding the Chernobyl nuclear reactors, you discover an old floppy disk in your luggage with a note on it. Rather than freaking about the possible amount of radiation the disk has, you decide to pick it up to read the note.
        The message is in Ukranian but luckily, you know how to read it. A majority of the message is irrelevant but you see the GPS coordinates of the location of a safe. Along with that, you read that the safe contains many invaluable things and how the key to the safe is somewhere on the disk.
        When you finish reading, you go to your grandparents house and stick the irradiated floppy disk into their ancient computer. While your hair is falling out, becoming nauseated, and seeing random sores pop up, you begin to comb through the contents of the disk.
        The disk contains a lot of fragmented files, and white space due to the long exposure of radiation. Now you're bald and tasting metal, but you finally find a weird file containing a simulation program that trains new technicians. Perhaps the key somewhere in "this program"...</td>

The bad news is that the story is a bunch of random text that I don't understand. There is a sticky note on the side of the screen that may help us understand the text. It says \"Blanche Fisher Wright forty-six down and one to the right.\" This may give us part of the text, if not all of it.</td>

#### Regex used to assist in generating this file (The first block is placed in the "Find" block and the second in the "Replace" block in sublime)

**Find Block:**

        (.+): ?
          name: (.+)
          points: .+
          state: .+
          (file|path): .+
          flag: .+
          description: \|
            ([\w\W]*?)\n(?=\n)

**Replace Block:**

        <tr>
          <td>\2</td>
          <td>\1</td>
          <td><a href="https://github.com/mitre-cyber-academy/2014--\1">2014--\1</a></td>
          <td>\4</td>
        </tr>

Next, you will need to do a find replace to get rid of all links:

**Find Block:**

        \[(.*)\]\(.*\)

**Replace Block:**

        "\1"
